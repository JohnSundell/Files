    Files is a compact library that provides a nicer way to handle files and folders in Swift. Itâ€™s primarily aimed at Swift scripting and tooling, but can also be embedded in applications that need to access the file system. It's essentially a thin wrapper around the FileManager APIs that Foundation provides.
